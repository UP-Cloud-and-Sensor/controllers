# BLE examples

> [!NOTE]
> BLE (Bluetooth Low Level) can work with devices without pairing

The ESP32 has a BLE module so it can collect data from tags and other sensors.

Code examples:
- [BLE scan](../examples/ble_scan.cpp) finds devices with BLE
- [BLE server](../examples/ble_server.cpp) can receive data from connected devices
